In order to generate the network as well as the data that will be used for the regression, please use the Rcode provided, there will be 4 different files calculating the entropy and gini-coefficients for both imports and exports.
There are also 2 other codes to add the world bank data to the dataset gini and entropy calculated, both of those have can be changed to include exports or imports

In order to perform the regressions, I have then provided some code in stata(1 for each of entropy:import and exports, gini:imports and exports)
as well as some code comparing the parallel trends in the world against the eu for both exports and imports

All datasets are also provided in the Data file.(including the original world input output database used)
